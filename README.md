INSTALLATION:
Install the 64 bit strawberry PERL for Windows

## LEARNING
Visit the [Perl Website](https://learn.perl.org/) for basics about the language

## HOW TO USE PERL?
In the command prompt window you can run any perl script by launching
> c:> perl c:\path\to\script.pl

You can search Perl Modules (libraries) from the [CPAN](http://www.cpan.org/) website and install them by entering into CPAN first
> c:> CPAN

after which the install command will be:
> cpan:> cpan Module::Name

You can run other tools included in Strawberry Perl like: perldoc, gcc, gmake ...

## TEXT EDITOR
To create perl scripts you need a text editor that's not included with Strawberry Perl like Padre (which can be installed by running "cpan Padre" from the command prompt) and [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) which both include syntax highlighting for Perl scripts.
