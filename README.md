## INSTALLATION
Install the 64 bit strawberry PERL for windods 10 system

## LEARNING
Visit the [Perl Website](https://learn.perl.org/) for basics about the language

## HOW TO USE PERL?
In the command prompt window you can run any perl script by launching
> c:> perl c:\path\to\script.pl

You can search Perl Modules (libraries) from http://www.cpan.org/ and install them by entering into CPAN first
> c:> CPAN

after which the install command will be:
> cpan:> cpan Module::Name

You can run other tools included in Strawberry Perl like: perldoc, gcc, gmake ...

## TEXT EDITOR
To create perl scripts you need a text editor that's not included with Strawberry Perl like Padre (which can be installed by running
"cpan Padre" from the command prompt) and Notepad++ (which is downloadable at
http://notepad-plus-plus.org/ ) which both include syntax highlighting
for Perl scripts.
