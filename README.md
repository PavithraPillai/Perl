INSTALLATION:
Install the 64 bit strawberry PERL for windods 10 system

LEARNING:
Visit: https://learn.perl.org/
for basics about the language

HOW TO USE PERL?
In the command prompt window you can:

run any perl script by launching

c:> perl c:\path\to\script.pl

install additional perl modules (libraries) from http://www.cpan.org/ by

c:> cpan Module::Name

run other tools included in Strawberry Perl like: perldoc, gcc, gmake ...

TEXT EDITOR:
To create perl scripts you need a text editor that's not included with Strawberry Perl like Padre (which can be installed by running
"cpan Padre" from the command prompt) and Notepad++ (which is downloadable at
http://notepad-plus-plus.org/ ) which both include syntax highlighting
for Perl scripts.
